# globalstrim-test-task

Test task for GlobalStrim candidates

Deadline: Friday 22 Apr 2016 - 21:00 GET

## Overview

Create a web application in which user can register and view and edit his profile.

### Registration fields:

* Name
* Phone number
* Birthdate
* Address
* ID Scan (accept JPG, PNG, PDF up to 2MB)

When user registers they must be redirected to the profile view with the information they specified during registration.

Users also must be able to edit all the fields in their profile.

In addition to the above all the operations should also be accessible via RESTful API (JSON and/or XML based).

## Technical requirements

Backend Platform: Java SE8 + (Spring Boot or Java EE7)

Frontend Platform: Either HTML5 + Javascript (single page app), or server-side based on JSP or Thymeleaf or Freemarker/Velocity

RDBMS: any embedded SQL via JPA

Project Management: Maven

## Additional requirements:

* All fields must be validated during both registration and edit
* Birthdate should only be editable once
* Tests should cover as much code as possible
* The application should be runnable without installation of anything besides JVM an WildFly (the latter should only be needed if Java EE7 was used).
* Code should be posted to github: fork this repository, add your code, push. I'd also like to see intermediate commits, not only the final version. Final version should be tagged with '1.0-final'
